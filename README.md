# Starling Android

Starling is a new and very WIP project that aims to create a self-hosted, personal, privacy friendly alternative for Google Photos.

## Envisioned structure

Starling will initially be composed of three different components:

1. Starling Android application
2. Starling back-end sync infrastructure
3. Starling web interface

## Features

The Starling Android application will contain the following set of features:

- Display all media (photos and videos) on a phone in a scrollable grid view.
- Have a separate tab that displays all media items in folders instead of a grid
- Automatically sync new media to the back-end
- Display all media that is saved on the back-end
- Remove media from the device and/or back-end
- Option to view location data on media
- Basic editing options for images and possibly videos
